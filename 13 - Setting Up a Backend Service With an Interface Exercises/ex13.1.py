# Implement a Flask backend service that tells whether a number received as a parameter is a prime number or not.
# Use the prior prime number exercise as a starting point.
# For example, a GET request for number 31 is given as: http://127.0.0.1:5000/prime_number/31.
# The response must be in the format of {"Number":31, "isPrime":true}.
