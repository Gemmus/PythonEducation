# Extend the previous program by creating a Building class.
# The initializer parameters for the class are the numbers of the bottom
# and top floors and the number of elevators in the building.
# When a building is created, the building creates the required number of elevators.
# The list of elevators is stored as a property of the building.
# Write a method called run_elevator that accepts the number of the elevator
# and the destination floor as its parameters.
# In the main program, write the statements for creating a new building and running the elevators of the building.
