# Again, extend the program by adding a new drive method that receives the number of hours as a parameter.
# The method increases the travelled distance by how much the car has travelled in constant speed in the given time.
# Example: The travelled distance of car object is 2000 km. The current speed is 60 km/h.
# Method call car.drive(1.5) increases the travelled distance to 2090 km.
